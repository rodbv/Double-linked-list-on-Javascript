An attempt to create a double-linked list on Javascript, doing TDD (QUnit).

Right now this is an incomplete implementation, even though the most important parts are already there: 
it is possible to get the head and the tail of the list, and iterate over it, 
as well as get any value in it by its value (first match is returned).
